# Nostr Account Setup Consultation - 25k Sats Bounty

Looking for expert guidance from **Turi$mo** on setting up and optimizing my Nostr presence. This consultation is worth **25,000 sats** for comprehensive answers to the following questions.

## Account Discovery & Visibility

- [ ] **Hashtag Strategy**: What hashtags do you recommend for bounty discoverability on Nostr?
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Integration**: Is cross-posting from X (Twitter) to Nostr possible and advisable?
- [ ] **Verification & Visibility**: Do I need NIP-05 verification to be more visible? How important is getting verified?

## Profile Management & Client Strategy

- [ ] **Multi-Profile Setup**: Is it a good idea to use 2 profiles on 1 Nostr app (like LB and personal accounts on Primal)?
  - [ ] **Dedicated Clients**: Or would it be better to use dedicated clients for each profile (personal on Primal, LB on Amethyst)?
- [ ] **Profile Key Issue**: Why do I have the same Nostr verified address but different profiles/public keys?

## Technical Configuration

- [ ] **Relay Recommendations**: What relays would you recommend for discovery on Nostr?
- [ ] **Relay Connection Issues**: LB Nostr relays aren't showing up, even after resetting to default. Any thoughts on why this might be happening?

## Multi-User Wallet Setup

- [ ] **Shared Wallet Management**: What are your suggestions for setting up a Nostr wallet on Primal when multiple users control the LB Nostr account across different devices?
